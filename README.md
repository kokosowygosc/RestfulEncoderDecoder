# RestfulEncoderDecoder
Simple task of making Restful api with two endpoints. \
This app has landed on heroku. [URL](https://restful-encoder-decoder-app.herokuapp.com) \
First endpoint is [v1/encode](https://restful-encoder-decoder-app.herokuapp.com/v1/encode) \
Second is [v2/decode](https://restful-encoder-decoder-app.herokuapp.com/v2/decode)

You can play with is as you want. \
First give some input to encoder (first endpoint), \
then try to decode the result in decoder (second endpoint).
